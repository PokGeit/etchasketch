This project is an assignment that I made as part of the Foundation Course of the Odin Project.

In this sketch board you can make simple drawings by hovering your mouse over it. You can either draw in rainbow mode (random colors are being selected) or normal mode. In the normal mode, the selected tile becomes darker the more you interact with it.

With the Clear button you can clear the sketch board.

With the slide bar you can change the amount of tiles, ranging from 4 (2x2) to 16,384 (128x128).
